        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Creamy goat cheese, spicy jam, salty ham, and peppery arugula are combined in the best ham sandwich you'll ever eat.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 French baguette about 30-36 inches</li>
            <li>6 ounces whipped or extra creamy goat cheese</li>
            <li>4-6 tablespoons spicy pepper jam</li>
            <li>2 ounces arugula</li>
            <li>1 pound deli ham sliced very thin</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the bread in half lengthwise, forming two flat halves. Spread the goat cheese on each section of bread.</li>
            <li>Layer arugula on the bottom half and then ham over the greens. Fold and crumple the ham as you layer it on the bread. Form piles of ham across the bread to create the best texture.</li>
            <li>Spoon the jam over the goat cheese on the top half of the bread. Close the sandwich and slice into smaller sections. Serve immediately.</li>
